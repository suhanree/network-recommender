    - In my project, I took this chance to explore recommendation systems that
    involves social networks.
(2)
    - The big question here is 'can networks improve out predictions in machine
    learning algorithms?'
    - Specifically, here the question I am asking is 'If we know friend
    relations between users, can we improve recommendation systems?'
    - The answer is apparently yes, but I'd like to explore how.
(3)
    - I use data from Yelp dataset challenge.
    - There are 1.6M reveiws, 61K businesses from 10 cities, and 366K users
    with social network, which has 2.9M edges (friendship relations).
(4)
    - At first, I had to find 10 communuties, here cities.
    - Businesses are classified first, and then users based on their reviews.
    - But there are 5% of users who left reviews on multiple cities. In that
    case, I looked at their friends.
(5)
    - This graph tells you how they are distributed over 10 cities.
(6)
    - Now we can analyze data city by city.
(7)
    - The simplest approach we can do is using friends.
    - If we want to predict a rating for (user, business) pair, we only look at
    how this user's friends rated the given business.
    - This model will be compared with other models.
(8)
    - Then we can ask: will that work?
    - We can see that if we look at this graph.
    - x is the number of friends considered and use the average of thier
    ratings as predictions. Then RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) becomes lower
    than the baseline model when that number is greater than 3.
    - The baseline model just uses the average rating for the
    business as a prediction. 
(9) 
    - How we evaluate models? K-fold cross validation has been used.
(10)
    - Here I am showing some preliminary results.

(11)
    - Social networks can be useful.
    - There are many ways to incorporate them.
    - Hybrid models should be considered to have better results.
    - There are many possible applications since there are available social
    networks.
