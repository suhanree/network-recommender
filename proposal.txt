## Final Proposal (06/10/2015)

Here I pick the proposal 1 out of the three preliminary proposals.
At this moment, there is no change from the previous plan.

### Feature selection vs Data selection: how can we use clusters from networks to enhance performance?

One of the biggest questions of mine has been how we use network structures of entities in addition to traditional datasets with features, to enhance machine-learning algorithms.
In traditional machine-learning problems, we have a table of rows, where each row becomes a data point that represents a set of features.
Then we use machine-learning algorithms (supervised or unsupervised) to deal with these data points.
For example, (1) in recommender systems, each data point represents a user, and ratings for each item becomes a set of features; (2) in bag-of-words algorithms in natural language processing, each data point is an article, and frequecies of each word (multiplied with inverse-document frequencies) comprise a feature set; (3) in fraud detection, a data point is a user, and characteristics of each user is a feature set; and so on.
In addition to these data sets with features, what if we have an underlying network structure (represented by graphs) between these data points?
Can we utilize this information to enhance precision of our predictions?
I know this is a well-known problem, and many data scientists (and even some start-up companies, I am sure) are tackling this very question already.
For example, network analysis can be very useful in [fraud detections](http://sctr7.com/2014/06/27/the-cutting-edge-network-analytics-for-financial-fraud-detection-and-mitigation/).

There are many directions we can go.
But here I decided to focus on how we can use cluster information from network structure to enhance the performance of our machine-learning algorithm, in consideration of the fact that we have limited time and resources for this project.
There are many available datasets with features and networks, and an example is the Yelp dataset from the [Yelp Dataset Challange](http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge) with the size of about 2GB.
It has a social network of 366K users for a total of 2.9M social edges (with 1.6M reviews with star ratings), collected from 10 cities.
Using all or a subset of data, we can focus on star ratings of businesses, and a network of users.
By only considering star rating information, we can generate the ratings matrix like in recommender systems, but here we also have social network of users.
We can use SVD as usual for recommendations, but what if we can group users based on social networks?
In social networks, we are more likely to connect with others when they have similar characteristics.
Then if we recommend using these groups of users (we can call this as *data selection* where we select rows, compared to *feature selection* where we select columns), we might be able to find bettter recommendations.
A simplest thing we can do for grouping is using direct neighbors of users, or we can add more indirect neighbors upto a certain distance.
The accuracy of each model will be measured using cross-validation.
There are many more interesting things we can do, and I intend to add more as the project is being develped.

I will use slides for the presentation with a blog and a github repo.
